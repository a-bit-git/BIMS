# Getting Started with Create React App

Netlify Deployment - [https://bim-system.netlify.app]

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

📘 Project Description

This Bookstore Management System is a web-based application developed as part of an assessment assignment. The objective of this project was to design and implement a functional bookstore interface that allows users to view, add, edit, and manage book records efficiently. Since the assignment did not provide any external API, database, or data source, the application was developed using static and dummy data to demonstrate functionality, structure, and user interaction. The project focuses on clean UI design, modular React components, and proper navigation to fulfill all requirements mentioned in the assignment.

✅ Key Features & Implementation Details

The project is built using React.js with functional components and hooks.

No external API or backend service was used because the assignment did not provide any API links or data sources.

The application includes the following main modules:

View All Books – Displays books category-wise using accordion layout.

Add Book – Allows users to add new books using a popup modal.

Edit Book Details – Enables editing book information through a modal window.

Delete Book – Provides confirmation-based deletion.

Reusable modal components are used to avoid code repetition.

Categories are organized into predefined lists for better structure.

Navigation is handled using React Router.

The UI is designed to be simple, responsive, and user-friendly.

Proper validation and form layout are implemented for book details.

GitHub is used for version control and project management.

📝 Assignment Compliance

This project has been developed by strictly following the assignment guidelines:

All required pages and features have been implemented.

No API integration was done as no backend or data source was provided.

Clean folder structure and readable code practices are followed.

Proper commit history is maintained using Git.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
